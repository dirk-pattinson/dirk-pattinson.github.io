# Dirk Pattinson

I'm a mathematician turned computer scientist, and a Professor
at the Australian National University. Prior to joining ANU, I held
a (senior) lectureship at Imperial College London, a lectureship at
the University of Leicester, and was a Research Associate at LMU
Munich.

## Research Interests

- **Modal logics**, especially coalgebraic semantics and automated reasoning  
- **Domain theory**, with a focus on computation over continuous data  
- **Logic and category theory** in computer science

## Overview

My research is broadly concerned with applications of logic in computer science. I am particularly interested in the foundations of computations with infinite objects (such as exact real numbers) and their logical analysis (e.g., infinite behaviour of computational systems). 


Currently, my main application focus is logic-based knowledge representation: formalising knowledge in application domains using logical formulae, enabling consistency checks and compositional integration of various reasoning principlesâ€”including probabilistic information and non-monotonic conditionals.
